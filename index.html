Many businesses have websites designed, but don't know how their content is affecting traffic once we hand over the keys. Our solution was to create an application that would make this information accessible and tailored for each website's needs. </p> <p> I designed a templating engine to integrate traffic metrics into customized infographics for the last reporting period. These templates compile the client's Google Analytics data into email reports which provide tangible feedback on the effects of ad campaigns, content, and other changes. </p> </div> <div class="medium-6 columns"> <p> The web application is a dashboard for web developers to generate and tailor these automated reports for their clients. Developers can pick relevant metrics for each client, include common suggestions for SEO optimization, and build these into their email templates. </p> <p> Once a reporting schedule has been chosen, templates will be filled with Analytics data, optimized for email, and automatically sent out to the developer's clients. </p> <p> We look forward to our service launching and being available for licensing in the upcoming months. </p> <h5>Technologies used:</h5> <kbd>Laravel, PHP, AngularJS, MySQL, responsive design</kbd> </div> </div> </article> <article class="gallery-slide"> <div class="gallery-image" style="background-image: url('images/banner_protatomonster.fe202648.jpg')"> <a class="gallery-nav gallery-nav-left gallery-overlay">&lt;</a> <a class="gallery-nav gallery-nav-right gallery-overlay">&gt;</a> <h2 class="gallery-overlay">Protatomonster</h2> </div> <div class="gallery-content"> <div class="medium-6 columns"> <p> Protatomonster is a YouTube channel that showcases player submitted footage of <em>League of Legends</em>. After joining the team as a volunteer in 2011, our viewership grew and we were rapidly approaching one million subscribers. With the increase of traffic, it became clear that a stronger web presence was needed. As a result, I was offered a position as Protatomonsterâ€™s lead web developer. </p> <p> Using a custom-written content management system, I built an entirely new website that was powerful enough to support our video heavy content needs. With the success of our new website, we were receiving more video submissions than we could keep up with. </p> </div> <div class="medium-6 columns"> <p> To combat this problem, I created a heavy-duty management application. The application takes all received content, catalogues it, and distributes it to the appropriate team member. Throughout this process the applicant is able to track the progress of their submission. </p> <p> To this day, almost one hundred thousand video submissions have successfully gone through this process. </p> <h5>Technologies used:</h5> <kbd>PHP, jQuery, MySQL</kbd> </div> </div> </article> <article class="gallery-slide"> <div class="gallery-image" style="background-image: url('images/banner_teamsummon.fea75c62.jpg')"> <a class="gallery-nav gallery-nav-left gallery-overlay">&lt;</a> <h2 class="gallery-overlay">TeamSummon</h2> </div> <div class="gallery-content"> <div class="medium-6 columns"> <p> TeamSummon was a third-party service created to improve and bring a social element into the <em>League of Legends</em> queueing experience for players frustrated with the low average quality of randomly assigned teammates in ranked ladders. </p> <p> I developed an algorithm to form teams of compatible players, based not only on in-game statistics, but also on their preferred roles and feedback from other users. </p> <p> I designed the rich interface, and supported it with a powerful backend queueing application. TeamSummon linked each player's account to a social presence through an innovative verification process. This allowed players to interact beyond the game by following other players to see updates on their play as well as posts they made. </p> </div> <div class="medium-6 columns"> <p> TeamSummon's launch was met with an overwhelming response. Over 100,000 users registered for our service within a month of launch, and tens of thousands of players were matched. </p> <p> Riot Games eventually implemented similar functionality into the official <em>League of Legends</em> client in the form of the Team Builder queue, a proud proof of concept for TeamSummon. </p> <h5>Technologies used:</h5> <kbd>PHP, jQuery, Redis</kbd> </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> </article> <article class="large-12 columns"> <h2 data-magellan-destination="open-source">Open Source</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="medium-3 columns"> <a id="open-source"></a> <h3>See more on:</h3> <div class="row"> <div class="small-6 small-offset-3 medium-12 medium-offset-0 columns"> <a href="//github.com/ianseddon"> <img src="images/GitHub_Logo.2cf0b2ea.png" alt="My GitHub"> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="large-6 large-offset-3 medium-7 medium-offset-2 columns"> <p> I often enjoy working on open source projects in my spare time, spanning a wide range of my interests.
